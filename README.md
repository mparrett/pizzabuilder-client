# Vue.js Pizza Builder Client

Here's my humble submission for the Tanga software engineering challenge.

I'd been recently intrigued by [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and 
both seemed to fit well for this project, so I decided to use them. To make it look presentable, I used 
Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

This application is hosted on GitHub Pages @ https://mparrett.github.io/pizzabuilder-client

### Design Considerations

Overall design focused on staying simple, clean code, and good organization. The user experience is intended to 
be intuitive and easy.

Feature creep happened as always and was entertained somewhat, justified by wanting to kick the tires of Vue.js 
and demonstrate a few interesting ideas.

### Notes and Next Steps

This project was a lot of fun. Vue.js is pretty powerful and a blast to work with. VS Code is a decent code editor too, although I barely scratched the surface.

Here are some areas I'd consider focusing on next:

- Replace javascript alerts with Vue.js modal component
- Add pagination to Pizzas and Toppings
- Possibly re-organize the project using components
- Polish some of the Bootstrap pieces
- Possibly re-concept some or all of the interface. Columns made sense at the time.
- Re-loading from the API
- Realtime collaborative editing (something along the lines of Meteor.js)
- Webpack or similar
